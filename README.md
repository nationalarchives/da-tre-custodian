# Introduction

This is a copy of config files used to set up cloud custodian in TRE accounts.

The files were moved here from the TRE V1 da-transform-terraform-environments repo during the destroy of V1

See https://github.com/nationalarchives/da-tre-dev-documentation/blob/a8e811075cedf8a2f02539b062ada527d5f43c25/runbooks/cloudcustodian/README.md?plain=1
for details of this implementation.

The implementation covers V1 and V2, it is not touched during the destroy of V1 and is continues to run on V2
(see JIRA TDRD-45 for confirmation it is running/notifying at the time of V1 destroy)
